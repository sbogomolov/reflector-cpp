# Cut a release. From a clean main in sync with origin/main, this confirms the version, waits for CI
# (ci.yml) to pass on HEAD, then tags v<version> (from CMakeLists.txt via version.sh) and pushes it.
# Gating on CI here means a release is never cut on a commit whose CI is red or still running. Pushing
# the tag triggers .github/workflows/release.yml, which re-checks CI, builds the per-arch binaries,
# publishes the multi-arch image to GHCR, and creates the GitHub release. The version in CMakeLists.txt
# is the single source of truth; the pushed tag is re-checked against it by the "Tag version check"
# workflow. Requires the gh CLI (authenticated) for the CI check.
